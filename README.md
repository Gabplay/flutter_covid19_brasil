This repository is based on "flutter_google_maps_clusters" and its data is from https://github.com/wcota/covid19br.
This website also shows detailed info about covid-19 in Brazil - https://wcota.me/covid19br
Using flutter I think users can have a better usability in mobile.

* Known bug: Locations are loading only after the second time the app is opened
* Requests using httpClient didn't get full csv file for some reason, so I'm using flutter_downloader to store the file locally and read it.
